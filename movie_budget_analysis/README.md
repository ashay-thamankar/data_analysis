# Movie Budget Analysis with Linear Regression

## Introduction
Welcome to the Movie Budget Analysis project! In this project, we explore movie budget and revenue data scraped from [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets), aiming to answer the question: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office?

## Learning Objectives
Today, you'll learn:
- How to use Seaborn, a popular data visualization library.
- How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn.
- How to plot a regression scatter plot to visualize relationships in the data.
- How to create a bubble chart to represent three dimensions.

## Explore and Clean the Data
Let's start by exploring and cleaning the dataset:
- **Rows and Columns:** The dataset contains 5,391 rows and 6 columns.
- **NaN Values:** No NaN values present.
- **Duplicates:** No duplicate rows.
- **Data Types:** The data types include Rank, USD Production Budget, USD Worldwide Gross, USD Domestic Gross.

### Key Statistics
- Average Production Budget: $31,113,737.58
- Average Worldwide Gross: $88,855,421.96
- Minimum Worldwide and Domestic Revenue: $0.00
- Films Losing Money: 37.2% of films do not recoup their production budget.

### Visualizations
Explore the [Bubble Chart](https://github.com/ashay-thamankar/data_analysis/blob/main/movie_budget_analysis/charts/Movie%20Releases%20over%20Time%20scatter%20plot.png) to see the explosion in movie budgets over the years.

## Decades Analysis
We used floor division to convert the release year into decades:
- Old Films (before 1970): 153 films.
- New Films (1970 onwards): The bulk of films in the dataset.

### Interesting Fact
The most expensive film prior to 1970 was "Cleopatra" with a production budget of $42 million.

## Linear Regression Analysis
We applied a linear regression model to understand the relationship between budget and revenue. The equation of the regression line is:

\[ Revenue = 22,821,538.64 + 3.1 \times Budget \]

Here are the key results:
- Slope Coefficient: $3.1
- Intercept: $22,821,538.64
- R-Squared: 0.029 (indicates a relationship between budget and revenue)

### Predictions
For a $350 million film budget, the estimated revenue is around $600 million.

## Conclusion
The project provides valuable insights into the relationship between movie budgets and revenue, showcasing the industry's growth and the risks associated with film finance.
