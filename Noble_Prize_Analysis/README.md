Comprehensive Noble prize analysis

Analyse a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize. Let's see what patterns we can uncover in the past Nobel laureates and what can we learn about the Nobel prize and our world more generally.

On November 27, 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will in Paris. When it was opened after his death, the will caused a lot of controversy, as Nobel had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. Alfred Nobel dictates that his entire remaining estate should be used to endow “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”. Every year the Nobel Prize is given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.
