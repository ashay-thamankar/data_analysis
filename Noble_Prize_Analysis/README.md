# Nobel Prize Analysis Project üèÜüìä

## Introduction üöÄ

Welcome to the Nobel Prize Analysis project, where we delve into the historical data of Nobel laureates to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Established by Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prize is awarded to individuals and organizations that have made outstanding contributions to humanity in various fields, including chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.

## Data Overview üìà

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about Nobel laureates, including their birth dates, motivations for winning, prize shares, and more. The analysis spans from the inception of the Nobel Prize in 1901 up to the latest available data.

## Data Exploration & Cleaning üßπ

### Preliminary Exploration üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Shape of df_data:** The dataset contains a certain number of rows and columns, providing an overview of the data's size.
- **Column Names and Data Types:** Examining the column names and their corresponding data types helps in understanding the information available in the dataset.
- **First Nobel Prize Year:** Determining the year in which the first Nobel Prize was awarded sets the historical context.

### Data Cleaning üßº

- **Handling Duplicates:** Identifying and addressing any duplicate entries in the dataset.
- **Date Conversion:** Converting date columns, such as birth_date and year, into appropriate datetime objects.
- **Percentage Share Calculation:** Adding a column, share_pct, to represent the laureates' share as a percentage.

## Exploration and Visualization üîçüìà

The core of the analysis involves exploring and visualizing the data to derive meaningful insights:

- **Percentage of Male vs. Female Winners:** Utilizing a Plotly Donut Chart to visualize the distribution of male and female Nobel laureates. ![Percentage of Male vs. Female Winners](https://github.com/ashay-thamankar/data_analysis/blob/main/Noble_Prize_Analysis/charts/Percentage%20of%20Male%20vs.%20Female%20Winners_pie_chart.png)

- **Exploration by Category:** Examining the distribution of Nobel Prizes across different categories, identifying repeated winners, and analyzing the trends over time. ![Number of Prizes Awarded per Category](https://github.com/ashay-thamankar/data_analysis/blob/main/Noble_Prize_Analysis/charts/Number%20of%20Prizes%20Awarded%20per%20Category%20bar%20chart.png)
