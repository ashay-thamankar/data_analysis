Comprehensive study on impact of handwash

 Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 who worked in the Vienna General Hospital. In the past, people didn't know about bacteria, germs, or viruses. People illness was caused by "bad air" or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and making arguments based on data. Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Dr Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever (i.e., puerperal fever). He studied the impact of handwashing and got the result there itself.
 
 In this projct we can get to know about:
  to make a compelling argument using data,
  to superimpose histograms to show differences in distributions,
  to use a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to show a graphic estimate of a distribution,
  to use scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values,
  to highlight different parts of a time series chart in Matplotib.
